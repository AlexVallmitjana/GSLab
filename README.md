# GSLab: Open-Source Platform for Advanced Phasor Analysis in Fluorescence Microscopy

## Summary

The phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging is a widely used method for image analysis in biophysics and a range of other fields. GSLab addresses the need for effective image analysis tools in fluorescence microscopy by providing an open-source platform that enhances traditional phasor analysis with advanced features. Key capabilities include machine learning-based clustering, real-time monitoring, and quantitative unmixing of fluorescent species. Designed for both commercial and custom systems, GSLab provides researchers with comprehensive lifetime and spectral phasor image analysis tools to tackle complex biological problems.

## Installation
To run **GSLab.mlapp**, ensure the **scripts** folder is located in the same directory as the .mlapp file. Follow these steps to set up and launch the program for the first time:
1.	Open MATLAB and navigate to the **Home** tab.
2.	In the **Environment** section, click **Set Path**.
3.	In the **Set Path** window, click **Add with Subfolders**.
4.	Browse to the directory containing GSLab.mlapp and the scripts folder, then click **Select Folder**.
5.	Click **Save** in the Set Path window and then click **Close**.
To launch the program, type GSLab in the MATLAB command window.
Once the path has been saved in MATLAB, simply type GSLab in the command window to run the program in subsequent sessions.
